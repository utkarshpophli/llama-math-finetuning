# 🧮 LLaMA Math Wizard 🦙

Welcome to the LLaMA Math Wizard project! We're teaching an AI llama to be a math genius. 🎓

## 🌟 What's This All About?

Ever wished you had a magical llama that could solve math problems? Well, now you do! We've taken the brilliant LLaMA-2-7b-chat model and sent it to math school. The result? A fuzzy, four-legged, formula-crunching friend!

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Fine-tuned LLaMA-2-7b-chat model with a PhD in Mathematics
- 📊 Trained on a diverse mathematics dataset
- 🖥️ Streamlit app for chatting with your new math tutor
- 📈 TensorBoard integration for beautiful learning curves
- 🔍 QLoRA magic for efficient training

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository (no llamas were harmed in the process):
```
git clone https://github.com/utkarshpophli/llama-math-finetuning.git
cd llama-math-wizard
```
2. Install the required packages (llama food):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Log in to Hugging Face (llama face optional):
```
huggingface-cli login
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Train your llama:
```
python src/train.py
```
2. Chat with your math wizard:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
